# MechaMail

MechaMail is a simple email client built with React. It fetches emails from a mock API and lets you mark emails as read or favorite. The application persists your preferences in the browser's localStorage and offers a clean, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Email Fetching:** Retrieves a list of emails from the Flipkart Email Mock API.
- **Mark as Read:** Mark individual emails as read.
- **Favorite Emails:** Mark emails as favorite.
- **State Management:** Uses React hooks (or `useReducer`) to manage state efficiently.
- **Persistent Preferences:** Stores your read and favorite preferences in localStorage.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI.

- **Header:** Contains the top navigation or branding.
- **MailList:** Displays the list of emails and handles selection.
- **MailBody:** Renders the content of the selected email and allows marking it as favorite.

## Customization

### Updating Email Preferences

The project uses localStorage to persist your preferences. The code structure allows you to easily update how emails are marked as read or favorite. You can modify the logic in the corresponding functions (e.g., `markAsRead` and `markAsFavorite` in `MechaMail.jsx`).

### Styling

Tailwind CSS is used for styling. Feel free to customize the classes in your components or modify the Tailwind configuration to suit your design needs.
